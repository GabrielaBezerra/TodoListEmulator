# Todo List Emulator

- This is a small, single page, flutter project (tiny, maybe?) using:
  - Provider
  - Cubit
  - State
  - Repository
  - Dartz
  - Hive
 
## Goal
- I have built this project to experiment with Copilot. I am trying to make it write good unit tests by itself for me.
- *The goal is to cover 100% the methods inside the cubit and repository with unit tests*.
- It has not worked very well so far. I always have to look and correct the tests AI writes. But at least it buys me time, writing all the boilerplate.

## Contribution
- Feel free to contribute, expand, and use it in whatever way you want.
